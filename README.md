# TypeScript - Basics

## Introduction

This is your lab for today! :wink:

We have learned some super useful things about TypeScript in class. Please keep reading and work on the following iterations. 

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

## Instructions

### Exercise 0 - Test

Will be explained in class

###  Exercise 1 - Basic Types

There are 6 small exercises within this. Hover over the red squigglies and fix each error that you see.

To run this part of the exercise, open your terminal and type
```shell
ts-node index.ts
```
By doing that it's running the uncommented lines in `index.ts`

```
import exercise1 from  './src/Exercise_1_Basic_Types/exercise1';
exercise1();
```

You will see a lot of errors in your terminal. Your task is to fix those errors by looking at the `exercise1.ts` file in `Exercise_1_Basic_Types` folder.

In case you're stuck for too long, uncomment these two lines in `index.ts`  and comment out the two lines from above to see the solution.

```
// ======== Solution 1: Basic types ========
import solution1 from  './src/Exercise_1_Basic_Types/solution1';
solution1();
```

and run `ts-node index.ts` again to see the required output.

Repeat the same process for all the exercises

###  Exercise 2 - Functions

###  Exercise 3 - Classes

###  Exercise 4 - Interfaces

###  Exercise 5 - Code Flow



Happy Coding! :heart:
